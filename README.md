# Introduction to Artificial Intelligence
### Description

This project was conducted as part of the coursework for the *“Introduction to Artificial Intelligence”* module in the MSc Artificial Intelligence programme at **City, University of London (City St George’s)** during the Autumn 2025 term. The project was completed by **Nasos Karas** and **Sania Verma**.

The study uses the **Ocular Disease Recognition (ODIR-5K)** dataset obtained from Kaggle, which consists of retinal images labeled across multiple ocular disease categories. The primary objective of this project is to investigate, compare, and fine-tune different artificial intelligence models, including classical machine learning and deep learning approaches, to address the task of ocular disease image classification.

Due to limit computational capacity, the notebook of this project was split into multiple notebooks so it could be run in parallel. In order to preserve the output of the ran cells, we decided
to keep different notebooks, instead of merging everything into one and losing all information.

The notebooks are described below and should be ran in the following order:<br><br>
**1_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb**: contains the code for data preprocessing,image downsizing, vector creation, standardization, pca. <br>
**2_SVM.ipynb**: contains the code for svm models and results.<br>
**3_CNN.ipynb**: contains the code for cnn models and results.<br>
**4_VGG16.ipynb**: contains the code for vgg16 models and results.
